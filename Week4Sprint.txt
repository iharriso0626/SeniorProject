Sprint Number: Sprint 4

Sprint Goals

    Build ISO image with xorriso.

    Resolve bootloader and kernel errors.

    Reach Switch Root in VM.

Accomplishments

    Ian ran xorriso -as mkisofs and built bootable ISO from /samos-workdir/iso.

    Bennett tracked down and copied vmlinuz-linux-zen, initramfs, intel-ucode.img.

    Added missing ISOLINUX files like ldlinux.c32, isolinux.cfg.

    VM boot reached "Failed to Switch Root", indicating initramfs is loading.

Challenges

    ISO wouldn't boot without proper kernel/initramfs in place.

    Required manual copying from existing Arch install and fixing paths.

Next Steps

    Finalize isolinux.cfg.

    Begin troubleshooting the switch_root service.
